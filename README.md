# SmallButCompleteWindowsApp
This is my final project for CS 3280.  It is written in C# and it is a small but complete windows application.  There are three windows forms in this project.  The first one is just a welcome screen.  The second lets you upload employee information to a SQL database.  The third lets you search through the database for different departments.
